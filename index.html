                    Muhammad Yunus[a] (born 28 June 1940) is a Bangladeshi economist, entrepreneur, politician, and
                    civil society leader, who has been serving as Chief Adviser of the Interim Government of Bangladesh
                    since 8 August 2024.[1] Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for founding the Grameen

                    in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.[3] Yunus is one of only seven people in the world
                    to have received all of these awards.
                    In 2012, Yunus became Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland, a position he held
                    until 2018.[4][5] Previously, he was a professor of economics at Chittagong University in

            <p>The Bangabandhu Satellite-1 is the first Bangladeshi geostationary communications and broadcasting
                satellite. It is named after the first president of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. It
                was manufactured by Thales Alenia Space and launched on 12 May 2018 from Kennedy Space Center, USA. The
                satellite was the first payload launched by a SpaceX Falcon 9 Block 5 launch vehicle. With the launch,
                Bangladesh became the 57th country to independently operate a satellite in space.</p>

                Architect Paul Rudolph was commissioned in 1965 to design a master plan that would remake the former
                college campus for the university. Construction of the major buildings that were part of this project
                would continue for a decade.
                Students at the university were politically active in the 1969 East Pakistan mass uprising. They
                boycotted classes on 23 January in response to police firing on students in Dacca.[12] In Mymensingh, on
                24 January, two people were killed by police firing and 20 were wounded on the picket lines.
