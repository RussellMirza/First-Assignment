                    Muhammad Yunus[a] (born 28 June 1940) is a Bangladeshi economist, entrepreneur, politician, and
                    civil society leader, who has been serving as Chief Adviser of the Interim Government of Bangladesh
                    since 8 August 2024.[1] Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for founding the Grameen

                    other national and international honors, including the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom
                    in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.[3] Yunus is one of only seven people in the world
                    to have received all of these awards.
                    In 2012, Yunus became Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland, a position he held
